      "Onions are bulbous vegetables that belong to the Allium family, known for their strong flavor and pungent aroma. They have layers of fleshy, concentric scales covered by a papery outer skin. Onions come in various types, including yellow, white, red, and green onions, each with its own flavor profile ranging from sweet to sharp. When sliced or chopped, onions release sulfur compounds that can cause tearing in the eyes. They are commonly used in cooking for their ability to enhance the flavor of dishes and can be eaten raw, saut√©ed, caramelized, or added to soups, salads, and stews. Onions are a versatile vegetable widely used across cuisines for their depth of flavor and nutritional benefits. They are typically grown underground and form a round, layered bulb that can vary in size and shape. Onions are rich in antioxidants, especially quercetin, and have anti-inflammatory properties. They also contain vitamins like B6, C, and folate, along with minerals such as potassium and manganese.",
